# arduino-automatic-irrigator
Irrigation automation not only helps save water but also optimizes plant growth, making it an ideal choice for gardeners, farmers and technology enthusiasts. These reasons influenced the choice of the theme of my project: an automatic irrigator that uses the Arduino Uno. I had the opportunity to present this project at TECPUC school, in 2023, as part of the Robotics discipline, under the guidance of professor FÃ¡bio Bettio.

After watching several videos on YouTube, I collected information that served as a basis for customizing the project according to my preferences. One of the modifications I made was to incorporate an LCD display.

In short, this project is an automatic irrigator that uses a soil moisture sensor. The system is controlled by Arduino and displays information about soil moisture on an LCD display.
